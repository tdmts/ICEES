/* ============================================================
   Adds the navigation row above the <h1> of a theory page or an
   assignment page: "Terug naar ..." on the left, the module menu in the
   middle and "Volgende: ..." on the right. The row is sticky, so it is
   the only one. Self-running -- just include the script, no init call:

     <script src="../../../back-link.js"></script>

   This file is a copy of the same file in tdmts/DeN, which was itself
   cut down from tdmts/Microcontrollers. It is a copy and not a shared
   file on purpose; CLAUDE.md, "Relation to tdmts/DeN", says why. The
   differences from Microcontrollers are deliberate and worth knowing
   before you merge anything back:

     - A module is a NAMED folder under Labo/ or Theorie/
       (Labo/LinuxBasis), not a numbered LaboN/. The labs of this course
       are independent modules, so a number would suggest an order that
       does not exist.
     - There is no exercises.js and no XP. A module here has one large
       assignment instead of a numbered list of small ones, so there is
       no "Oefeningen" tab, no done-flag and no dashboard.
     - The theory folder is Theorie/, not Reference/. The hub inside it
       is still reference.html, and the manifest is still reference.js
       under window.LAB_REFERENCE, so the engines stay mergeable.
     - The module hub is overview.html.

   THE EXAMPLES BELOW STILL NAME DeN MODULES (RS485, ManagedSwitch).
   They are the cases that shaped this code and they are described
   accurately; nothing in this repo is called that. Replace them with
   this course's own once the modules under Labo/ exist.

   EEN ORION-TOPIC IS DE GRENS
   ---------------------------
   Every page of this site is read inside an iframe on Orion, and Orion
   has a menu of its own beside it. A lab has one entry there per part:
   Inleiding (overview.html), Theorie (Theorie/reference.html), Opdracht
   (Opdracht.html), plus the dropbox the student hands his verslag in to.
   ManagedSwitch has two opdrachten, so it has two of each.

   That menu does not move when the iframe does. Navigating downward
   inside a topic is therefore fine, and the menu is merely coarser than
   where you are: click a theory page and Orion says "Theorie" while you
   read Wat is RS485. Navigating sideways to another topic is not fine.
   The menu then says "Inleiding" while the opdracht is on screen, and
   the one list the student can orient himself by is telling him
   something untrue.

   So: this row never leaves its topic. A reeks of reference.js is one
   topic, and everything the row offers (back, the menu, volgende) stays
   inside it. Crossing over is done with target="_blank" from a link in
   the text, which opens a second window and leaves the iframe, and
   therefore the Orion menu, exactly where it was.

   TARGET (TERUG)
   --------------
   The root of the topic: the page the Orion menu entry points at. For a
   page under Theorie/ that is that folder's reference.html, read off the
   path so it survives a missing manifest. For any other reeks it is the
   first entry of that reeks, which for the Packet Tracer exercises of
   ManagedSwitch is PacketTracer/Opdracht.html.

   A page that IS that root gets no back link, and neither does a page in
   no reeks at all. Both used to point at overview.html, which is exactly
   the sideways jump described above. With no menu and no forward link
   left either, those pages get no row at all, the way overview.html
   never had one.

   "TERUG NAAR WAAR JE VANDAAN KWAM"
   ---------------------------------
   If the student arrived by clicking a link on another page of this same
   topic (document.referrer, same origin, a different .html page, and in
   this reeks or its root), the link points back to THAT page instead.
   Anything else (a bookmark, a direct visit, a page from another topic
   opened in a new tab) falls back to the root.

   When the referrer happens to be the root anyway, the specific label is
   kept instead of the neutral "Terug naar vorige pagina".

   TARGET (VOLGENDE)
   -----------------
   The next entry WITHIN THE SAME CATEGORY of reference.js, in array
   order. A category is a sequence of its own and they are not chained
   together: the theory of Labo ManagedSwitch and its Packet Tracer
   exercises are different kinds of work, so the last theory page does
   not page into the first exercise. On the last entry of a category the
   link points at the hub rather than leaving a dead end, unless the back
   link already points there, in which case it is dropped instead of
   shown twice. Datasheets are skipped: a PDF carries no nav of its own.

   A page gets a forward link when reference.js lists it, whatever folder
   it sits in. The manifest decides, not the path: Labo ManagedSwitch has
   its Packet Tracer exercises in PacketTracer/ rather than Theorie/, and
   they are part of the same reading order. A page it does not list, such
   as the landing page ProCurve/Opdracht.html, simply has no forward link
   and no read-flag, which is what a landing page wants.

   On the last entry of a reeks the forward link goes to the root of the
   topic, the same page the back link points at everywhere else in it.
   The root itself has no forward link when it is also the last, which
   would be a link to the page you are on.

   Pages are matched on their resolved path, not on their filename. A
   module may hold two pages with the same name (ProCurve/Opdracht.html
   and PacketTracer/Opdracht.html), and on filenames the one would answer
   to the other's manifest entry.

   This means a page in the chain must load reference.js. Without it the
   page renders perfectly and only the forward link disappears, which is
   exactly the kind of silent failure the content check asserts against.

   HET LABOMENU
   ------------
   The sticky row carries the module's menu in the middle: a button
   ("Theorie 3 / 7", "Packet Tracer 5 / 9") opening a panel with the
   topics of this module, each with a tick for the ones already read. It
   exists because these pages are read inside an iframe on Orion, where
   clicking a topic replaces the only list the student had.
   orion-embed.css gives that iframe a fixed height, so the page scrolls
   inside it and a sticky bar stays put at the top of the Orion content
   pane.

   The panel lists the reeks this page is in, and nothing else. The
   button names that reeks and counts within it, so a Packet Tracer
   exercise never reports itself as a theory page. A reeks holding one
   page is named and not numbered ("Zelftest", not "Zelftest 1 / 1").

   It used to carry a tab per reeks. That was right while a whole module
   was one entry in Orion, because the tab strip was then the only way to
   reach the other list; now every reeks is an entry there and a tab is a
   jump out of this topic. Microcontrollers builds its two sections from
   two manifests, so this reads differently there.

   A page in no reeks gets no menu. The only list it could show belongs
   to another topic, and an empty panel reads as a fault rather than as
   "you are not in a sequence".

   GELEZEN
   -------
   A theory page has nothing to finish, so the only honest thing to
   record is that it was opened. This file writes that flag --
   msDashboard:{labId}:theory:{topicId} -- as soon as it recognises the
   page in reference.js, and reads it back for the menu and the hub. It
   is the one write this script does; everything else here only reads.
   Every read is wrapped in a try: a browser that blocks storage for an
   embedded third-party frame throws on the first one, and losing the
   ticks beats losing the whole nav row.

   Skips itself on overview.html (and any page without a .container/<h1>),
   and builds no row on a page with nothing to put in one.
